## Overview

The code runs perfectly, with no issues found.
It passes through all validators, and JavaScript validators detect no significant errors. 
The game's core mechanics have been implemented, including player turns, win-checking, and a basic computer opponent.

## Features

- Dynamic creation of the Tic Tac Toe board.
- Basic CSS customization for early stage appearance.
- Implemented a game reset button to restart the game.
- RAW check system to determine a winner and display it in an Alert window.
- Added a basic computer logic for an opponent that makes random moves.

## Bugs and Fixes

- Bug Fix: If 'X' draws 3 in a line, you still need to continue with placing 3 more 'O' to display the "YOU WIN" message.
- Bug Fix: If 'O' draws 3 in a line, you still need to continue with placing 4 more 'X' to display the "COMPUTER WINS" message.
- Bug Fix: Reordered the sequence of functions for checking the winner and toggling the player.
- Bug Fix: An additional placing was needed to trigger the winner message. Fixed by updating the sequence of functions.

## Potential Improvements

- Improve AI logic with a priority system based on specific patterns on the board.
- Implement difficulty modes by adjusting AI priorities.
- Add a delay function to block user input during the computer's move for a smoother game experience.
- Implement a 2-players mode using the previous version code before the computer logic.
